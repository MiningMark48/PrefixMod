# Prefixation

Prefixation is a mod that adds prefixes to your weapons and armor to make them better (or worse).

## How do I use the mod?
When you craft a **Sword**, an **Axe**, or a **Chestplate** a prefix will be assigned as well as some attributes.

Use the **Tinkerer's Workstation** to reforge the item into a new prefix with a new set of attributes.

Running the command `/prefix_reforge <type>` will also reforge the item. This command only works for server operators.

### Configs
In the conifg file, labeled `prefixation.cfg`, you will find a range of configs for controlling which prefixes can be added.

More configs will eventually be added to control all aspects of the prefixes.

## Supported Mods
Any mod that uses vanilla's system for a sword (ItemSword), an axe (ItemAxe), or a chestplate (ItemArmor) will be compatible. 

This mod does **not** add special cases for any mods, including Tinker's Construct.

## More to come
There will be more to come to this mod, such as more prefixes, more configuration settings, and possibly custom prefixes. Only time will tell.
