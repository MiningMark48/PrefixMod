# PrefixMod

PrefixMod (Final Name TBD) is a mod that adds prefixes to your weapons and armor to make them better (or worse).

## How do I use the mod?
When you craft a Sword, an Axe, or a Chestplate a prefix will be assigned as well as some attributes.

Running the command `/prefix_reforge <type>` will reforge the item into a new prefix with a new set of attributes. This command only works for OPs.

## More to come
There will be more to come to this mod, such as more prefixes, configuration settings, and possibly custom prefixes. Only time will tell.
